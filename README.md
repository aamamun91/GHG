We consider in this note that readers are familiar with key assumptions used in the carbon footprint of agriculture (see for instance Cheng, 2017 or the Tier 1 procedures (IPCC 2006) used in construction of the FAOSTAT database). 

Out goal is to produce a dataset of emissions, both for production and land use, based on FAOSTAT, and a few complementary data. An important task is to reverse engineer any aggregated numbers to identify individual coefficients that could be used both in Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the World Bank project to discriminate properly between the 4 drivers of emissions: scale (eg size of herd, cropland), location, composition and technological choice.

While FAOSTAT is a great source of information, and their approach is pretty robust, we will differ on a number of elements to:

•	Increase the coverage of emissions (e.g. energy emissions are missing in FAOSTAT aggregated numbers and only synthetic fertilizers are included for chemicals while pesticides have very large emission factors too, see Table 1);

•	Update technology of production and consistency between emissions assumption and the IO structure of the CGE (fertilizer coefficients used in the FAOSTAT emissions database are quite outdated);
•	Classification of emissions (e.g. burning savannah should be treated as a land use emission in our framework).
